# 8-Puzzle Solver
Use 3 different algorithms to solve 8-Puzzle problem:
1. Uniform Cost Search
2. A* with Misplaced Tile heuristic
3. A* with Manhattan Distance heuristic

Trace of the Manhattan distance A* on the following problem: 

1 2 3

4 * 6 

7 5 8

The best state to expand with g(n) = 2 and h(n) = 1 is...
